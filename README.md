## Program


## Dataset

Just like you, we have been looking for several years some dataset to train our models. For instance, the <a href="#">RecSys dataset collection
by Prof. Julian McAuley at USCD </a> has datasets, but due to copyright issues he only shares embeddings as .npy, but we need images to test if our recommendations are making sense!
