## Wikimedia Commons Dataset

Just like you, we have been looking for several years for some datasets to train our models. For instance, the <a href="#">RecSys dataset collection
by Prof. Julian McAuley at USCD </a> has datasets, but due to copyright issues he only shares embeddings as .npy. We need images to test if our recommendations are making sense!

We acknowledge the support of [Diego Saez-Trumper](https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/diego-saez-trumper/) from Wikimedia foundation to collect this dataset.
